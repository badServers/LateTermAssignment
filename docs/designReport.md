# Tic Tac Toe by badServers

Tic Tac Toe is a web game, just like the original the rules are that each player takes a turn, the first player puts an 'x' in the 3x3 board and then the second player takes a turn and puts an 'o'. This goes on until either one of the player has put his mark in three slots horizontal, vertical or diagonal in a row or when the board is full, which would be a draw.

## Features
* User can play the game with a friend or by himself.
* Message appears above the board that tells the user/s who's turn it is (X or O).
* A win can accure when three of the same marks are in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
* A message appears at the end of the game to tell the user/s who has won or if a draw has accured.
* Play again button clears the board so user/s can play again and gives user point if he won.
